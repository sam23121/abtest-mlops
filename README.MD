# AB-Hypothesis-Testing

# Classic and sequential A/B testing analysis

performming data exploration to count unique values of categorical variables, making histogram, relational, and other necessary plots to help understand the data. For each of the plots we produce, We will write a description of what the plot shows in markdown cells.

performming hypothesis testing: we will apply the classical p-value based algorithm and the sequential A/B testing algorithm 

in the notebook we try to answer this questions

    - Are the number of data points in the experiment enough to make a reasonable judgement or should the company run a longer experiment? Remember that running the experiment longer may be costly for many reasons, so you should always optimize the number of samples to make a statistically sound decision.
    - What does your A/B testing analysis tell you? Is brand awareness increased for the exposed group?
# A/B testing with Machine Learning
we Split  the data by browser and platform_os, and version each split as a new version of the data in dvc.

    - For each version of the data we will do the following
    - Split the data into 70% training, 20% validation, and 10% test sets.
    - we apply machine learning to the training data. Train a machine learning model using 5-fold cross validation
      using the following 3 different algorithms:
            - Logistic Regression
            - Decision Trees
            - XGBoost
            - RandomForest

    - we will Define the appropriate loss function  for the model using the validation data
